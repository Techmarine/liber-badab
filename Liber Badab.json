For each To Wound roll equal to or higher than the value listed, the target automatically suffers a Wound, regardless of its Toughness. The controlling player may choose to resolve these Wounds at AP 2 instead of the weapon’s normal AP value.\n\nSimilarly, if a model makes a Shooting Attack with a weapon that has the Rending special rule, a To Wound roll of equal to or greater than the listed value wounds automatically, regardless of Toughness, and is resolved at AP 2.\n\nIn either case, against Vehicles each Armour Penetration roll of equal to or greater than the listed value allows a further D3 to be rolled, with the result added to the total Strength of the attack. These Hits are not resolved at AP 2, but are instead resolved using the weapon’s AP value.\n\nFor example, a model with the Rending (5+) special rule that rolls To Wound against a non-Vehicle model will wound automatically on the roll of a 5+, and the attacking player has the choice of using an AP value of 2 instead of the AP value of their weapon"

In these cases, Hits are worked out as normal and can hit and Wound units out of range and line of sight (or even your own units, or models locked in combat). If the shot scatters so that the hole in the centre of the marker is beyond the battlefield’s edge, the shot is a complete miss and is discarded.\n\nOnce the final position of the Blast marker has been determined, take a good look at it from above – each unit suffers one Hit for each of the models included in that unit that is fully or partially beneath the Blast marker, even if those models are not within the firer’s line of sight.\n\nOnce the number of Hits inflicted on the unit has been worked out, roll To Wound and Save as normal.

This means they can fire at a target that they do not have line of sight to, as long as the target is beyond their Minimum Range (if applicable). When firing indirectly, the Ballistic Skill of the firer is not subtracted from the scatter distance; unless a Hit is rolled on the Scatter dice, the Blast marker always scatters a full 2D6\". If a Barrage weapon has line of sight to its target it can fire directly, even if the target is within its Minimum Range.\n\nNote that any Hits inflicted upon Vehicles by an Attack using the Barrage special rule are always resolved against the Vehicle’s Side Armour Value.\n\n\nMultiple Barrages\n\nIf a unit fires more than one shot with the Barrage special rule, they fire together, as follows:\n\nThe Barrage weapon closest to the target unit fires first. Place the Blast marker over the target, then roll for scatter as described earlier. Once the first marker is placed, roll a Scatter dice for each other Barrage weapon shot fired by the unit. If an arrow is rolled, place the marker in the direction indicated so that it is next to and touching the edge of the first marker placed (see diagram below). If a Hit is rolled, the firing player places the marker so that it touches any part of any marker in the group that has already been placed. Note that it is perfectly fine if some markers are placed overlapping one another (including being directly over the top of a previous marker).\n\n\nApocalyptic Barrage\n\n\nAn Apocalyptic Barrage follows all of the rules for a Barrage weapon, but uses the clover-shaped Apocalyptic Barrage marker. Before the marker is placed, the attacker is allowed to rotate the marker about its centre to maximise the number of models that could potentially be hit. Place the marker and roll for scatter in the same way you would for a Barrage. If the marker scatters, be careful to maintain the same orientation as you move it.\n\n\nOnce the final position of the marker has been determined, roll a number of dice equal to the number of attacks on the weapon’s profile. So, for example, with a weapon with the type ‘Heavy 4, Apocalyptic Barrage’, you would roll four dice. Each dice roll corresponds to a ‘strike’ on one of the circles on the Apocalyptic Barrage marker. For example, each roll of a 2 indicates a strike on circle number 2. Resolve the strikes as for a Multiple Barrage, as if each were a Barrage attack that had landed on that circle and hit all the models underneath it. To determine Cover Saves, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the entire Apocalyptic Barrage marker."
